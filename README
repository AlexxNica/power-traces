Power Traces

This is a set of power trace measurements taken from a secure
microcontroller performing a cryptographic operation.

This is a blind dataset, so the the specific operation performed in
each dataset is left unspecified. A different set of countermeasures
is enabled in each dataset. Which countermeasures are enabled is also
left unspecified.
